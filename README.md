# Netlogo-Projects

This GitHub repository encompasses a collection of NetLogo models simulating diverse scenarios involving turtles. Each project explores different aspects of agent-based modeling and includes unique features for a comprehensive understanding of agent behaviors.

## Projects Overview:

1. **Turtle Survival and Reproduction Simulation**
   - Represents a simulation where turtles navigate, consume gray patches for energy, reproduce, and track their survival.
   - New features include a "Clear Turtles" button for a fresh start and an energy plot graphing the sum of turtle energies.

2. **Random Movement in Variable Temperatures**
   - Simulates 10-100 agents moving randomly in a world with varying temperatures.
   - Allows users to experiment with layouts, turtle tracking, and observe movements in different environmental setups.

3. **Agent Color Influence Simulation**
   - Models agents influencing each other's colors within a defined vision radius.
   - Observes color convergence, influence levels, and the effect of vision radius on agent interactions.

4. **Archery Game Basics**
   - Simulates an archery game where players control a character shooting darts at moving targets.
   - Features target movement, scoring, and win/lose conditions.

5. **Dart Game Basics**
   - Simulates a game where humans with guns try to hit targets using darts.
   - Includes features like target creation, dart throwing, scoring, and extensions for added gameplay elements.

The repository showcases a variety of NetLogo features, from basic agent interactions and color blending to complex game simulations. Each project comes with detailed instructions on usage, observations, and opportunities for extension.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and learn from these models. For specific details on each project, refer to their respective README files in the corresponding project folders.
