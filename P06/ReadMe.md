**APL P03**
## WHAT IS IT?

(The Falling Objects Game is a simple simulation where a player-controlled container fire catches falling objects using arrow keys. Each catch earns points, and power-ups temporarily boost the container's speed. The game ends when a timer reaches zero, displaying a "Game Over!!!" message.

## HOW IT WORKS

(The Falling Objects Game works based on the following rules:

**Setup**:

Initialize a container fire at the top of the screen and falling objects with random speeds.
Create power-ups with a chance of appearing.

**Game Loop (Go)**:
Move falling objects downward, simulating their descent.
Allow player-controlled container to move left or right.
Check for collisions between the container and falling objects or power-ups.

**Scoring**:
Score points when the container catches falling objects.
Update the score display.

**Power-Ups**:
Increase the container's speed temporarily upon catching a power-up.
Display a message when the power-up duration is over.

**Game Over**:
Countdown a timer, and if it reaches zero, end the game.
Display a "Game Over!!!" message.

**User Input (Move-Container)**:
Respond to left and right arrow key inputs to move the container fire.)

## HOW TO USE IT

(To use the Falling Objects Game model, follow these instructions:

**Interface:**
1. **Setup Button:**
   - Click the "Setup" button to initialize the game with the default settings.

2. **Go Button:**
   - Click the "Go" button to start the game loop and allow falling objects to descend.

3. **Arrow Keys:**
   - Use the left and right arrow keys to move the container fire left and right, respectively.

4. **Score Display:**
   - Monitor the "Score" display to track your points as you catch falling objects.

5. **Timer Display:**
   - Watch the "Timer" display to know how much time is remaining before the game ends.

6. **Game Over Message:**
   - If the timer reaches zero, a "Game Over!!!" message will be displayed.

**Gameplay:**
- Catch falling objects by moving the container left and right.
- Earn points for each caught object.
- Catch power-ups to temporarily increase the container's speed.
- Be strategic with power-ups and aim for the highest score before the timer runs out.

**Note:**
- Adjust the code parameters (e.g., number of falling objects, speed) in the NetLogo Code tab for different gameplay experiences.
- Experiment with setup options and observe how changes impact the game dynamics.)

## THINGS TO NOTICE

(While running the Falling Objects Game model, pay attention to the following aspects to better understand the simulation:

1. **Scoring Dynamics:**
   - Observe how the score increases each time the container fire catches a falling object.
   - Take note of any variations in scoring when catching power-ups.

2. **Power-Up Effects:**
   - Notice the temporary increase in the container fire's speed when a power-up is caught.
   - Monitor the duration of the power-up effect and its impact on gameplay.

3. **Collision Handling:**
   - Observe how the game responds to collisions between the container fire and falling objects or power-ups.
   - Check if the game appropriately registers catches and updates the score.

4. **Timer Impact:**
   - Pay attention to the timer countdown and observe how it affects the game's duration.
   - Note how the game concludes with a "Game Over!!!" message when the timer reaches zero.

5. **User Input Interaction:**
   - Experiment with using the left and right arrow keys to control the container fire.
   - Observe how responsive the container fire is to user input.

6. **Variable Adjustments:**
   - Explore changing parameters in the NetLogo Code tab (e.g., number of falling objects, speed) to observe how they affect gameplay.
   - Experiment with different setup options to see how they influence the overall dynamics of the game.

By focusing on these aspects, you can gain insights into the game mechanics and how various elements interact to create the gaming experience.)
